How to swap images later
- Open each auth view (Login/Register/Logout) and change the <img src=\"...\"> URL.
- Keep high-resolution images (width around 1200+) for better visual quality.

Note
- Login POST behavior already existed before (role-based redirect demo).
- If real authentication is needed later, implement it in AuthController + service layer.
